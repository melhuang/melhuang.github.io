Call it coding, programming, hacking, whatever you want. To a non-CS major, it might as well be a foreign language. In fact, it's several. Java, Python, C; they're all just different ways of writing the same thing. So what is Computer Science? It's just a different, very logical, way of thinking. Tackling a problem from ten different approaches, waiting to find the right solution. It's adding a semicolon and watching everything work. Computers are as straightforward as it gets. They don't have a consciousness; you can't sweet-talk a computer into doing what you want. It's beautiful. So, the best description I can offer is that Computer Science is a way of talking to the computer, to kindly ask it to add some numbers, manipulate some input, to make life just a little bit easier.
