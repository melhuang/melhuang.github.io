One year ago, I promised myself a less crappy [year in review](/posts/a-crappy-year-in-review/), but alas here I am again writing this with little forethought. However, thanks to my circle of good friends, I started 2023 with explicit goals that we presented to each other over dinner. At the beginning of the year, I was working at Calm on the heels of our CTO departing; I had a measly 3:56 marathon PR and my writing was wobbly.

**Career**

I knew 2023 was the year I would leave Calm. While leaving a job may sound easy, there was much more wrapped into this. I had [really liked](/posts/one-year-of-calm/) my job for many reasons and I especially loved [my team](/posts/i-love-my-team/). I left in March, much earlier than intended. I realized that the [new role](/posts/into-the-unknown) combined with a new VP, new CTO and new CEO made my job very different than the one I wanted. Each change in isolation may have been okay, but I knew I could not be an effective engineering leader in the resulting environment and it was best for the company and for my team that I exit. Nine months later, I'm super happy with the decision, having had time to disentangle my identity from work a little bit, think about what I want in my career and having started at Included Health.

**Running**

This year I wanted to run a 3:30 marathon. In March at the Napa Valley Marathon, I had a very enjoyable 3:34 race and felt confident that I could run a faster time in the fall. I happily continued training, spending lots of time on trails in the summer. Unfortunately I sustained a nasty ankle injury in July that still has me regularly limping and gingerly running. Iâ€™m still being willfully ignorant to the reality of the injury -- this is the first year Iâ€™ve felt any indication of the physical ailments that come with age. Even so, I managed to run 1300 miles and bike 1200 miles.

**Writing**

At the beginning of the year, I set the goal of publishing 20 new posts. With this post, Iâ€™m at 14. I cooled off on writing this year, due to feeling like my thoughts were exceptionally irrelevant. I originally [started](/posts/intro) writing to demystify the engineering manager role. Perhaps as Iâ€™ve become more familiar with the industry, Iâ€™ve wanted to write about it less for fear of stating the obvious or disillusioning others. For better or for worse, I will either put forth my genuine opinion or say nothing at all.

This year felt a lot slower, in a good way. It feels like Iâ€™ve regained my footing from the self-induced chaos of the past several years. I regret not spending a little more time exploring new things, like a new country (although I did just come back from Nicaragua ðŸ¤”). I feel myself become more thoughtful and less reactive. Iâ€™m quite happy with my personal relationships, mostly pleased with my career, and mildly ambivalent with my physical fitness, but grateful for full mobility.

In 2024 I will definitely have a coding goal, stubbornly set a more aggressive marathon goal and noodle on something thatâ€™s just for fun. ðŸ˜„
