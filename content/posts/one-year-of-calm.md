Happy first Calmversary to me! I am revisiting where I was one year ago and where I am today.

I joined Calm for reasons that after a year, continue to hold true.

1. I deeply care about **mental health**. Back in 2016, I was going through a period of extreme anxiety and couldn‚Äôt sleep for weeks. I tried _everything_, but it wasn‚Äôt until a friend suggested the 7 Days of Calm that I slept through the night. The Calm app introduced me to mindfulness and I‚Äôve been deeply happier along the journey. I continue to be fulfilled by working on a tool that brings tranquility to millions of people.
2. **Career growth**. Calm is a growing company and my specialty of consumer subscriptions is core to the success of the business. Every day is the right balance of new, challenging problem shapes I haven‚Äôt seen before and opportunities to hone skills that I‚Äôve been developing for years.
3. Table stakes: I want to genuinely like the people I work with, receive a fair compensation and have plenty of time in my life for the things that keep me happy and healthy ‚Äì exercise, friends and a long list of hobbies.

After a year of leading a remote team in the midst of a pandemic, driving forward large, business-critical projects and nonstop thinking about how to scale engineering capabilities, I‚Äôve concluded a number of things about myself:

1. I‚Äôm certain that my career is in **engineering leadership**. I am far more useful to the bottom line in enabling teams and driving execution than I am as an individual contributor. Starting at Calm as a manager (rather than transitioning into management at a company) gave me the ‚Äúfull taste‚Äù of being an engineering leader by setting the expectation from day 1.
2. **This job is really hard**. Every single day, I‚Äôll jump from having emotionally taxing one-on-one conversations with direct reports and immediately context-switch into something technically complex while trying not to be the blocker on five different projects and then into a strategic product planning session with too many stakeholders and opinions to count. I am a lot more forgiving to myself and to others when mistakes happen, given how much is going on.
3. I‚Äôm not yearning to go back into the office full-time. While I am a 10/10 extrovert, I can‚Äôt imagine spending every day scuttling between conference rooms or squeezing in the time to look presentable in person after a hard morning workout. üòÖ

Someone asked offhand at a happy hour recently: ‚Äúdoes anyone really love their job?‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt miss a beat to say, ‚ÄúI love my job!‚Äù While this is partially driven by my conscious [decision to look at the bright side](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/03/how-to-change-your-personality-happiness/621306/), it‚Äôs honestly been a great year, and I‚Äôm extra grateful to my team at Calm for the laughs and camaraderie while building our beautiful product.
