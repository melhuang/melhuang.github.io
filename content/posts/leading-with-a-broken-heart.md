Everything is so much harder when you have a broken heart. It’s a feat to get up in the morning, to muster up an appetite, to do anything except drown in crippling sadness. If being an EM wasn’t already a circus [tightrope act](https://increment.com/planning/planning-for-engineering-managers/), having a gaping hole inside your chest will certainly complicate the capacity to hold in your mind the details of concurrent projects and the careers of your direct reports.

Something happens when the body goes into [sudden withdrawal](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/fashion/breakups-rejection-neuroscience.html). Everything tenses up and the body goes into overdrive defense mode so anything beyond basic survival is off the table. Ironically, an engineering manager is supposed to be a source of certainty, direction and positivity for a team of engineers. But in no guidebook can you find step-by-step directions on how to run a cross-team meeting when all of your calm composure has been replaced with pure anguish.

The first time I experienced true heartbreak was back when I was an IC. I tried to hold it all together, suffering silently through team meetings and pull requests and code reviews, pretending everything was okay because I thought being an employee at work meant bringing the professional side only. But my brain failed to work. All of its previous ability to hold complex systems in working memory was replaced with frantically making sense of the emotional trauma that my body was sustaining. I lied and said I had allergies and it made me feel even more alone, not allowing myself to trust my colleagues.

One of my favorite qualities about myself as an engineering leader is my deep ability to empathize. I’ve felt imposter syndrome, loneliness, guilt – everything under the sun that we’re afraid to say out loud – and if I cannot bring my whole self to work, how can I expect the same from my teammates?

Working at a sleep and meditation company during a time of emotional turmoil is a blessing. Not only do I have direct access to the tools that help me breathe through the hardest moments and fall asleep, I am also lucky enough to work with compassionate coworkers who support me as I once again piece together my own future alongside that of the team’s.
