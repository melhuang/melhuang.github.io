I used to return home flooded with endorphins; instead I would be so mentally drained from my runs that I wanted to do little else.</p><p>Puzzled, I perused my training log and compared training weeks that I felt burned out versus non-burned out weeks.</p><figure><img src=/images/sidebyside1.png alt="(Two similar-looking training weeks, but felt like garbage during the bottom one.)"><figcaption><p>(Two similar-looking training weeks, but felt like garbage during the bottom one.)</p></figcaption></figure><p>The mileage and intensity were pretty comparable, so I looked at timing with my period, what was going on at work, trail versus road. Nothing stood out.</p><p>But when I grayed out solo activities and looked at the ratio to group activities, the answer became crystal clear. Turns out I could exercise with equal intensity but by simply running with friends, I could make the same thing more enjoyable.</p><figure><img src=/images/sidebyside2.png alt="(Same training weeks as above, but graying out solo activities.)"><figcaption><p>(Same training weeks as above, but graying out solo activities.)</p></figcaption></figure><p>At work, we often trap ourselves in a state of burnout. We think that suffering is admirable. We may not love every minute of what we do at work, but making it enjoyable is not impossible. As a manager, this is always my first endeavor when leading a new team. Since humans are social creatures, the easiest way is to foster interpersonal relationships and start having fun together. For me, loving the people I work with is the most effective way to stave off burnout.</p><p>I didn’t end up running my goal marathon time last year. But I learned my lesson and joined a running club this year so I have plenty of new friends to long run with.</p></div><footer class="post-footer clearfix"><div class=share></div></footer></article></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=site-title-wrapper><h1 class=site-title><a href=/>the misfit manager</a></h1><a class="button-square button-jump-top js-jump-top" href=# aria-label="Back to Top"><i class="fa fa-angle-up" aria-hidden=true></i></a></div><p class=footer-copyright><span>&copy; 2023 / Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></span></p></div></footer><script src=/js/jquery-1.11.3.min.js></script><script src=/js/jquery.fitvids.js></script><script src=/js/scripts.js></script></body></html>
