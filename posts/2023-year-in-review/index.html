However, thanks to my circle of good friends, I started 2023 with explicit goals that we presented to each other over dinner. At the beginning of the year, I was working at Calm on the heels of our CTO departing; I had a measly 3:56 marathon PR and my writing was wobbly.</p><p><strong>Career</strong></p><p>I knew 2023 was the year I would leave Calm. While leaving a job may sound easy, there was much more wrapped into this decision. I had <a href=/posts/one-year-of-calm/>really liked</a> my job for many reasons and I especially loved <a href=/posts/i-love-my-team/>my team</a>. I left in March, much earlier than intended. I realized that the <a href=/posts/into-the-unknown>new role</a> combined with a new VP, new CTO and new CEO made my job very different than the one I wanted. Each change in isolation might have been okay, but I knew I could not be an effective engineering leader in the resulting environment. It was best for the company and my team that I exit. Nine months later, I&rsquo;m super happy with the decision, having had time to disentangle my identity from work a little bit, think about what I want in my career and having started at Included Health.</p><p><strong>Running</strong></p><p>This year I wanted to run a 3:30 marathon. In March at the Napa Valley Marathon, I had a very enjoyable 3:34 race and felt confident that I could run a faster time in the fall. I happily continued training, spending lots of time on trails in the summer. Unfortunately I sustained a nasty ankle injury in July that still has me regularly limping and gingerly running. Iâ€™m still being willfully ignorant to the reality of the injury &ndash; this is the first year Iâ€™ve felt any indication of the physical ailments that come with age. Even so, I managed to run 1300 miles and bike 1200 miles.</p><p><strong>Writing</strong></p><p>At the beginning of the year, I set the goal of publishing 20 new posts. With this post, Iâ€™m at 14. I cooled off on writing this year, due to feeling like my thoughts were exceptionally irrelevant. I originally <a href=/posts/intro>started</a> writing to demystify the engineering manager role. Perhaps as Iâ€™ve become more familiar with the industry, Iâ€™ve wanted to write about it less for fear of stating the obvious or disillusioning others. For better or for worse, I will either put forth my genuine opinion or say nothing at all.</p><p>This year felt a lot slower, in a good way. It feels like Iâ€™ve regained my footing from the self-induced chaos of the past several years. I regret not spending a little more time exploring new things, like a new country (although I did just come back from Nicaragua ðŸ¤”). I feel myself become more thoughtful and less reactive. Iâ€™m quite happy with my personal relationships, mostly pleased with my career, and mildly ambivalent with my physical fitness, but grateful for full mobility.</p><p>In 2024 I will definitely have a coding goal, stubbornly set a more aggressive marathon goal and noodle on something thatâ€™s just for fun. ðŸ˜„</p></div><footer class="post-footer clearfix"><div class=share></div></footer></article></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=site-title-wrapper><h1 class=site-title><a href=/>the misfit manager</a></h1><a class="button-square button-jump-top js-jump-top" href=# aria-label="Back to Top"><i class="fa fa-angle-up" aria-hidden=true></i></a></div><p class=footer-copyright><span>&copy; 2023 / Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></span></p></div></footer><script src=/js/jquery-1.11.3.min.js></script><script src=/js/jquery.fitvids.js></script><script src=/js/scripts.js></script></body></html>
