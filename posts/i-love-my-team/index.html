It was just like any other recent meeting (lively technical discussion interspersed with laughter), but it was a perfect representation of the brilliant, efficient and goofy team that has made this past year of work so enjoyable.</p><p>I put a ton of time and energy into shaping this team, as individuals and as a whole. Despite warnings about perpetuating stereotypes by becoming the &ldquo;mom&rdquo; of the team (an organizational role that women typically fill), I choose to intentionally foster team dynamics because of how positively it impacts team output. When we enjoy each other&rsquo;s company and encourage each other to be better, we are happier and more collaborative.</p><p><strong>People first.</strong></p><p>As a remote-first company, we reside all over the world (Seattle to Florida to Croatia), with something like 6 different accents. We have vegans and non-vegans, parents and non-parents. With so much diversity, in-person time is extra crucial to establish common ground and build empathy. In May, we did a quick team gathering in San Francisco and in December, we all joined the company offsite in Palm Springs.</p><p>Spending time together allows us to connect as people and not just transactional colleagues. When we all genuinely like each other, we don&rsquo;t have to spend time sugarcoating communication. It also means we support and cover for each other through family emergencies, natural disasters and severe illness, all of which we&rsquo;ve endured together this year. The real proof is that we&rsquo;ve all started referring to our partners, children and pets by their names, because theyâ€™ve become part of our team as well.</p><p><strong>Maintain a quality bar.</strong></p><p>This is the part of my job that I lose the most amount of sleep over. Even though we have fun together, we come to work every day to exchange labor for compensation. As an IC, I&rsquo;ve been on teams where people would complain an underperforming peer, and the manager&rsquo;s lack of enforcement would be a silent acceptance of the level of output that was tolerable. As a result, everyone would get just a little bit worse. Being judicious about performance management is crucial to your team health and output.</p><p>Additionally, whether it&rsquo;s <a href=/posts/quit-alpha-dogging/>insolence</a> or lack of motivation, some folks don&rsquo;t think that contributing to a positive work environment is part of the job requirement. I only ever want people on my team who actually want to be there and are willing to contribute to an environment of positivity (i.e. <a href=/posts/the-burden-of-positivity/>be someone people want to work with</a>). This creates a healthy culture of optionality for each team member, to know that you are surrounded by people who are also choosing to be here.</p><p>I am really lucky to work with every individual on this team. Even though I cannot come close to capturing the feeling of camaraderie, in Palm Springs, I witnessed two members of the team sharing a slice of cake, four of them debugging a heat lamp, and the whole team pitching into tracking Jeff Warrenâ€™s every move so our resident fanboy could meet him.</p></div><footer class="post-footer clearfix"><div class=share></div></footer></article></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=site-title-wrapper><h1 class=site-title><a href=/>the misfit manager</a></h1><a class="button-square button-jump-top js-jump-top" href=# aria-label="Back to Top"><i class="fa fa-angle-up" aria-hidden=true></i></a></div><p class=footer-copyright><span>&copy; 2023 / Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></span></p><p class=footer-copyright><span><a href=https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter>Ghostwriter theme</a> By <a href=http://jollygoodthemes.com>JollyGoodThemes</a></span>
