But I am not talking about the greater cosmic loneliness problem that is occurring as we dive deeper into online connections. I’m professionally lonely.
As a manager, I’m a contractually obligated secret keeper. People tell me things that are legally risky to share; as an extreme example, building a termination case. It would be seriously problematic if I still went around telling everyone every new piece of information I learned."><meta name=HandheldFriendly content="True"><meta name=MobileOptimized content="320"><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.108.0"><meta name=robots content="index,follow"><meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"><link rel=stylesheet href=/dist/site.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/dist/syntax.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/dist/overrides.css><link rel=stylesheet href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:300italic,400italic,600italic,700italic,400,600,700,300&subset=latin,cyrillic-ext,latin-ext,cyrillic"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css integrity=sha384-wvfXpqpZZVQGK6TAh5PVlGOfQNHSoD2xbE+QkPxCAFlNEevoEH3Sl0sibVcOQVnN crossorigin=anonymous></head><body><div id=wrapper><header class=site-header><div class=container><div class=site-title-wrapper><h1 class=site-title><a href=/>the misfit manager</a></h1></div><ul class=site-nav></ul></div></header><div id=container><div class=container><article class=post-container><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>i’m lonely</h1></header><div class="post-content clearfix"><img class=post-featured-image src=__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/12/bigger-mountain-1.jpg><p>Before you click away, don’t worry, it’s not contagious.

This thin veil of secrecy inhibits trust and creates distance.</p><p>So what will we do about poor lonely manager Melissa, an overly friendly creature who craves social connection everywhere she goes?</p><p>I refuse to believe that we have to bury those trust-filled intimate connections. Rather, we have to consciously carve out professional secrets and find the appropriate spaces to discuss those.</p><p>One of my favorite meetings is a biweekly gathering of frontline engineering managers whose problem sets look similar to mine. Here, since we share the same purview, we are free to air our grievances in a setting that is appropriate for discussing sensitive topics. It’s true that misery loves company.</p><p>And in my case, I’m supremely lucky to have a best friend who is also a software engineering manager. The ability to share our professional woes and wins alongside those of our personal lives is core to my ability to maintain conviction in this career path.</p></div><footer class="post-footer clearfix"><p class=post-tags><span>Tagged:</span>
