I love the term ego-tucking, introduced to me 5 years ago by a wise mentor. This year I got really good at aligning my views and opinions with those of people above me in the organizational hierarchy. I wanted to get promoted, and did so. I have also cemented my commitment to building my career in the mental health space.</p><p><strong>Friends at work</strong></p><p>I’ve given far more constructive feedback this year than I ever have. Some of the recipients genuinely appreciated me for it, and a number of them probably thought it unwarranted. I learned that it is really hard to communicate areas of improvement to someone whose approval I seek more than I value the output of the team (i.e. friend-first vs colleague-first). Unfortunately as a result, I’ve gone too far in the other direction. For fear of making it harder for myself to act in the interest of the company, I have been minimizing social situations and coming across as quite bitchy. I’ll seek to restore the right balance here.</p><p><strong>Writing</strong></p><p>I <a href=/intro/>started writing</a> in late 2021. I didn’t really enjoy a lot of the writing I did this year because I worry more and more about saying the wrong thing or in more cases, leaving out nuance for sake of brevity and hoping someone doesn’t spear me for being inconsiderate.</p><p>I’ve had two engineering leaders whom I respect tell me this year that my writing will be career-limiting; my vulnerable style of writing is a liability when people are trying to hire for their leadership roles. What I find funny is that I don’t see this as particularly vulnerable. The term implies some degree of susceptibility to harm, but all the thoughts I share are ones I don’t guard. In fact, that comment is perfect because it acknowledges that this is a conventionally different approach to leadership – one that I would like to keep building upon. I shall continue writing.Overall I had a wonderful 2022. I ran more miles than I biked (1450 vs 1360), jaunted around Italy with my best friend and most importantly achieved homeostasis in <a href=https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/how-i-attained-persistent-self-love>Deep Okayness</a>. I’m setting very intentional goals for 2023, in hopes that in a year from now I can share a less crappy year in review.</p></div><footer class="post-footer clearfix"><div class=share></div></footer></article></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=site-title-wrapper><h1 class=site-title><a href=/>the misfit manager</a></h1><a class="button-square button-jump-top js-jump-top" href=# aria-label="Back to Top"><i class="fa fa-angle-up" aria-hidden=true></i></a></div><p class=footer-copyright><span>&copy; 2023 / Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></span></p><p class=footer-copyright><span><a href=https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter>Ghostwriter theme</a> By <a href=http://jollygoodthemes.com>JollyGoodThemes</a></span>
