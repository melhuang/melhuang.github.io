How much stability do you want to sacrifice for some acceleration? How much money would I be willing to leave on the table for a brighter career trajectory?</p><p>I joined LinkedIn in 2015. The job came with generous compensation, reasonable hours and great people. The mission of creating economic opportunity for the global workforce made sense, but I could not draw a clear connection between my daily lines of code and that outcome. I knew I had to find something that felt more right, but I didn’t have a clear answer to “what are you optimizing for” when I asked my mentor where I should go next. I ended up going to a tiny company, experienced a lot of things that I definitely didn’t want, and left after 10 weeks.</p><p>In retrospect, when I left LinkedIn, I subconsciously recognized that my job is a big part of my identity and that I was willing to give up money and perks to fulfill some kind of purpose. As I spent more time in the industry, the values that comprise this sense of purpose came into clearer focus. Coaching my direct reports gave me more satisfaction than merging a complex feature branch filled with weeks of code. Delivering features to millions of Strava users felt more rewarding than a compensation increase. Friends who were working at companies with value-aligned missions were genuinely happier than the ones who flaunted how much money they made. I felt more and more energized with every additional ounce of accountability and influence I was given.</p><p>This reflection of my one year at Calm captures my values of career growth and company mission, and I am willing to trade-off large amounts of money, work-life balance and technical problems for them. I’ll elaborate on why these are my top values in a separate post, but having this clear conviction in priorities reduces day-to-day waffling about whether I’m doing the right thing and keeps me focused on pursuing the things that matter to me.</p></div><footer class="post-footer clearfix"><div class=share></div></footer></article></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=site-title-wrapper><h1 class=site-title><a href=/>the misfit manager</a></h1><a class="button-square button-jump-top js-jump-top" href=# aria-label="Back to Top"><i class="fa fa-angle-up" aria-hidden=true></i></a></div><p class=footer-copyright><span>&copy; 2023 / Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></span></p></div></footer><script src=/js/jquery-1.11.3.min.js></script>
