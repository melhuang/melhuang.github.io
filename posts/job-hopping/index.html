It makes me wonder – is this person a dependable, committed candidate? This is hypocritical of me though because my resume would be a huge red flag to myself, which leads me to wonder if I am unreasonably judgmental of job hoppers.</p><p>Some of my friends met their spouses in college, or even earlier, in high school. I admire these people who are able to commit to a life partner without exploring other opportunities for potentially more compatibility. How do they know the grass isn’t greener on the other side?</p><p>Exploring multiple grass patches in my career has led to diverse experiences: engineering teams large and small, processes existent and non-existent, coworkers I like and don’t like. These multitudes helped me build perspective and learn that what I thought were deal-breakers were not true deal-breakers. Because I’ve concluded that everywhere has problems, but many can be fixed, I invest more energy into improving the situation I’m in instead of just <a href=/posts/the-burden-of-positivity/>griping</a> about them.</p><p>Similarly, it helped me identify my actual deal-breakers so I know to sniff them out during the interview process. In landing at Included Health, I intentionally avoided an incompatible manager and an ambiguous product roadmap. I have a difficult time with authority, so I really needed a manager that I like and respect. I also appreciated that the business has a clear strategy, which allows engineering to focus on technical and product problems.</p><p>The right answer to the number of jobs, much like the right number of people to date before marrying, is that there isn’t really a right number. It’s whatever amount of experiences help a person discover what matters to them, and that good things take investment and time.</p></div><footer class="post-footer clearfix"><div class=share></div></footer></article></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=site-title-wrapper><h1 class=site-title><a href=/>the misfit manager</a></h1><a class="button-square button-jump-top js-jump-top" href=# aria-label="Back to Top"><i class="fa fa-angle-up" aria-hidden=true></i></a></div><p class=footer-copyright><span>&copy; 2023 / Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></span></p></div></footer><script src=/js/jquery-1.11.3.min.js></script><script src=/js/jquery.fitvids.js></script><script src=/js/scripts.js></script></body></html>
