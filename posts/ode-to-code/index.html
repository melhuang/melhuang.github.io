For a second, I close my eyes amidst the Slack messages from cross-functional department leads. I take a break from planning the roadmap, planning the project, planning the offsite, planning sprint planning. I let myself dream of the life of no plans, of plans being put in front of me.</p><p>Sometimes when I was in the coding flow (that blissful state equated to runner’s high where it feels painless and so <em>right</em>), I felt like a brilliant wizard - creating something from nothing, where letters and words become delightful user interfaces. I often admired my code for itself - its composability, efficiency and readability. I would high-five each little function for taking in parameters, gently massaging them and plating them nicely for the next function. Hell, I even miss putting print statements everywhere, and I mean <em>everywhere</em>, only to realize that some cell reuse problem was mangling my values.</p><p>I definitely do <em>not</em> miss spending four hours on a bug that turned out to be a compiler optimization flag. I do not miss feeling like a cog in the wheel. But I deeply, deeply miss turning off my notifications and architecting elegant solutions to features that millions of people would use.</p><p>When I examine myself as an asset to a company, there’s no doubt that my value comes from enabling engineering teams to execute large projects and keeping everyone happy through the process. But if I let myself for a second disregard this drive to fulfill my own sense of career accomplishment, I cannot wait to get back into my little code world.</p></div><footer class="post-footer clearfix"><div class=share></div></footer></article></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=site-title-wrapper><h1 class=site-title><a href=/>the misfit manager</a></h1><a class="button-square button-jump-top js-jump-top" href=# aria-label="Back to Top"><i class="fa fa-angle-up" aria-hidden=true></i></a></div><p class=footer-copyright><span>&copy; 2023 / Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></span></p></div></footer><script src=/js/jquery-1.11.3.min.js></script>
