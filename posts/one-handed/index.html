I didn&rsquo;t think much of it beforehand except, knowing that I wouldn’t have a right hand for six weeks, I cleaned my apartment, prepared some meals and took the day off for surgery. I gave work a heads up.</p><p>Days one and two post-op were comical, in retrospect. I actually started working around 7am feeling pretty okay, but as the nerve block wore off, searing pain in my wrist started monotonically increasing. I was in the middle of a data quality meeting when a colleague mistook my contorted face for distaste toward the meeting, which made me realize that I failed to not only set expectations for myself but also for my coworkers. I frantically maxed out acetaminophen and ibuprofen while moving non-urgent meetings and unblocking multiple projects. I don’t have any prior experience taking oxycodone, but turns out it’s very effective at providing pain relief, at the low cost of your brain becoming a pile of cotton. Every minute for the next 60ish hours, I timed my painkillers and vacillated between pain-free and semi-conscious, or enduring what felt like getting my wrist actively cut open while trying to conceptualize proper auto-renewable subscription states.</p><p>Why didn’t I just take time off? Maybe I think I&rsquo;m really self-important and crucial to these projects or I didn&rsquo;t delegate and empower people properly. Or maybe I was already playing post-vacation catchup and recognized that I occupy a decision-making role and have a lot of context in a lot of initiatives. I could’ve definitely dropped some things, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s crazy to take my job seriously and suffer a little bit on account of my poor planning. Next time (knock on wood), I will definitely do more upfront work in preparation for taking some time off for surgery.</p><p>I’m fine now, which is to say my brain is my own again and I can stick this log of an arm in a sling and go outside. Now to test the limits of speech-to-text software as we enter this performance review cycle.</p><figure><img src=__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/10/log_arm.png alt="as seen on Zoom"><figcaption><p>as seen on Zoom</p></figcaption></figure></div><footer class="post-footer clearfix"><div class=share></div></footer></article></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=site-title-wrapper><h1 class=site-title><a href=/>the misfit manager</a></h1><a class="button-square button-jump-top js-jump-top" href=# aria-label="Back to Top"><i class="fa fa-angle-up" aria-hidden=true></i></a></div><p class=footer-copyright><span>&copy; 2022 / Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></span></p><p class=footer-copyright><span><a href=https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter>Ghostwriter theme</a> By <a href=http://jollygoodthemes.com>JollyGoodThemes</a></span>
