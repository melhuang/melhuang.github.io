I typically write about something in the past that I feel like I’ve conquered; it’s a lot harder to write about something when I don’t know what will happen.</p><p>I took on a new role at the start of the year – I have a new manager, new peers and a new set of stakeholders. The environment of novelty all around me is a breeding ground for feelings of uncertainty and self-doubt. Am I in over my head? Will I be able to succeed?</p><p>Despite this specific situation being new, I find myself practicing the same habits that have gotten me this far – through other unfamiliar, uncomfortable situations.</p><p><strong>Build knowledge and relationships</strong></p><p>When I’ve felt intimidated by new codebases in the past, I&rsquo;ll follow every call hierarchy and debug every view until I slowly build confidence through raw knowledge. In this case, I am digging deep into our metrics and user behaviors so I know the product inside and out when stakeholders ask questions. I also know from prior jobs that it’s very easy to be intimidated by people until I get to know them. Especially in leadership positions, building relationships is crucial to success. I’m getting to know my colleagues as people before trying to get anything done.</p><p><strong>Operate sustainably</strong></p><p>To ensure I can physically and mentally sustain a tough work life, I am rigorous about prioritizing sleep and exercise and managing stress. It might sound crazy, but my morning runs take 1-2 hours and I need 8.5 hours of sleep; as a result, I’ve jettisoned any plans that don’t suit my 8pm wind-down time. Even being well-rested, I still have to make the actual workday <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361287/>tolerable</a>. A new situation will inevitably create stress, but I minimize it as much as possible by decoupling unnecessary urgency from tasks. Leaders are often unaware of how much implicit weight their statements carry, so I specifically ask for timelines so as to not be constantly context-switching to the latest thing a higher-up pinged me on Slack. Having some amount of control over timing allows me to work hard but not be a maniac.</p><p><strong>Push yourself</strong></p><p>New experiences are always growth opportunities. With every subsequent marathon I’ve run, I improve on my two biggest challenges: fueling and pacing. In my career, I’ve gotten a lot better about not being a pain in the ass. The main thing I continue to work on is speaking clearly and concisely. Because this role centers even more around influence and leadership than my previous, more executional roles, I find myself being much more careful with my words and organizing my thoughts before meetings.</p><p>I’ve stepped into a new role many times; this time the stakes feel higher but I have less self-doubt. Because I’m staying healthy, I can take bigger risks and tolerate more uncertainty and discomfort. I’m reasonably confident in my methodology, but I’ll check back in a couple months and let you know how it’s going.</p></div><footer class="post-footer clearfix"><div class=share></div></footer></article></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=site-title-wrapper><h1 class=site-title><a href=/>the misfit manager</a></h1><a class="button-square button-jump-top js-jump-top" href=# aria-label="Back to Top"><i class="fa fa-angle-up" aria-hidden=true></i></a></div><p class=footer-copyright><span>&copy; 2023 / Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></span></p></div></footer><script src=/js/jquery-1.11.3.min.js></script>
