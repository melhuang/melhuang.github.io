I deeply care about mental health. Back in 2016, I was going through a period of extreme anxiety and couldn‚Äôt sleep for weeks.

I am revisiting where I was one year ago and where I am today.</p><p>I joined Calm for reasons that after a year, continue to hold true.</p><ol><li>I deeply care about <strong>mental health</strong>. Back in 2016, I was going through a period of extreme anxiety and couldn‚Äôt sleep for weeks. I tried <em>everything</em>, but it wasn‚Äôt until a friend suggested the 7 Days of Calm that I slept through the night. The Calm app introduced me to mindfulness and I‚Äôve been deeply happier along the journey. I continue to be fulfilled by working on a tool that brings tranquility to millions of people.</li><li><strong>Career growth</strong>. Calm is a growing company and my specialty of consumer subscriptions is core to the success of the business. Every day is the right balance of new, challenging problem shapes I haven‚Äôt seen before and opportunities to hone skills that I‚Äôve been developing for years.</li><li>Table stakes: I want to genuinely like the people I work with, receive a fair compensation and have plenty of time in my life for the things that keep me happy and healthy ‚Äì exercise, friends and a long list of hobbies.</li></ol><p>After a year of leading a remote team in the midst of a pandemic, driving forward large, business-critical projects and nonstop thinking about how to scale engineering capabilities, I‚Äôve concluded a number of things about myself:</p><ol><li>I‚Äôm certain that my career is in <strong>engineering leadership</strong>. I am far more useful to the bottom line in enabling teams and driving execution than I am as an individual contributor. Starting at Calm as a manager (rather than transitioning into management at a company) gave me the ‚Äúfull taste‚Äù of being an engineering leader by setting the expectation from day 1.</li><li><strong>This job is really hard</strong>. Every single day, I‚Äôll jump from having emotionally taxing one-on-one conversations with direct reports and immediately context-switch into something technically complex while trying not to be the blocker on five different projects and then into a strategic product planning session with too many stakeholders and opinions to count. I am a lot more forgiving to myself and to others when mistakes happen, given how much is going on.</li><li>I‚Äôm not yearning to go back into the office full-time. While I am a 10/10 extrovert, I can‚Äôt imagine spending every day scuttling between conference rooms or squeezing in the time to look presentable in person after a hard morning workout. üòÖ</li></ol><p>Someone asked offhand at a happy hour recently: ‚Äúdoes anyone really love their job?‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt miss a beat to say, ‚ÄúI love my job!‚Äù While this is partially driven by my conscious <a href=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/03/how-to-change-your-personality-happiness/621306/>decision to look at the bright side</a>, it‚Äôs honestly been a great year, and I‚Äôm extra grateful to my team at Calm for the laughs and camaraderie while building our beautiful product.</p></div><footer class="post-footer clearfix"><div class=share></div></footer></article></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=site-title-wrapper><h1 class=site-title><a href=/>the misfit manager</a></h1><a class="button-square button-jump-top js-jump-top" href=# aria-label="Back to Top"><i class="fa fa-angle-up" aria-hidden=true></i></a></div><p class=footer-copyright><span>&copy; 2023 / Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></span></p><p class=footer-copyright><span><a href=https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter>Ghostwriter theme</a> By <a href=http://jollygoodthemes.com>JollyGoodThemes</a></span>
