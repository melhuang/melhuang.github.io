<meta name=description content="Advent of Code is a 25-day programming puzzle challenge. It’s exactly like an advent calendar, except instead of a piece of chocolate, you get an equally delectable coding puzzle. This year, in a fit of determination to prove something to myself (or maybe to the ICs [1]), I embarked on the journey.
It’s currently Day 13, but I could not get past Day 12. In fact, I almost didn’t make it past Day 7, and barely squeaked by Day 10 (part 2)."><meta name=HandheldFriendly content="True"><meta name=MobileOptimized content="320"><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.121.1"><meta name=robots content="index,follow"><meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"><link rel=stylesheet href=/dist/site.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/dist/syntax.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/dist/overrides.css><link rel=stylesheet href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:300italic,400italic,600italic,700italic,400,600,700,300&subset=latin,cyrillic-ext,latin-ext,cyrillic"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css integrity=sha384-wvfXpqpZZVQGK6TAh5PVlGOfQNHSoD2xbE+QkPxCAFlNEevoEH3Sl0sibVcOQVnN crossorigin=anonymous><meta property="og:title" content="advent of code"></head><body><div id=wrapper><header class=site-header><div class=container><div class=site-title-wrapper><h1 class=site-title><a href=/>the misfit manager</a></h1></div><ul class=site-nav><li class=site-nav-item><a href=/>Posts</a></li><li class=site-nav-item><a href=/pages/about>About</a></li></ul></div></header><div id=container><div class=container><article class=post-container><header class=post-header><p class=post-title itemprop="name headline">advent of code</p><p class=post-date><span><time datetime=2023-12-13 itemprop=datePublished>Wed, Dec 13, 2023</time></span></p></header><div class="post-content clearfix"><img class=post-featured-image src=/images/aoc-leaderboard.png><p><a href=https://adventofcode.com/2023/about>Advent of Code</a> is a 25-day programming puzzle challenge.

I non-trivially adjusted my life to accommodate this challenge, mainly in the form of skipping morning runs since I stayed up too late coding. Here’s a couple takeaways.</p><p><strong>Coding is enjoyable. [2]</strong></p><p>It’s a nice change of pace directing all of my energy and focus into solving a singular problem. Too much of my job is spent bouncing from virtual problem to virtual problem, rarelly getting to a satisfying solution. This is the first extended period of coding since I became a manager, though I often <a href=/posts/ode-to-code>daydream</a> of it. I want to persist this practice; I’m setting a goal of coding 365 hours in 2024. While I could also consider switching my career back to full-time development, I’m certain that this company derives more value from my non-coding skills than from my coding ones.</p><p><strong>Coding builds community.</strong></p><p>Past companies I&rsquo;ve worked at have had small pockets of interest in AoC but this is the most active contingent I&rsquo;ve encountered. Even though I’m still pretty new to this company, it’s been fun joshing around with engineers I don’t work with. I’m really impressed by the enthusiasm and intellect of my coworkers, especially with the Engineering Director staking his claim in the top 5. I think the best software engineers (or any profession, for that matter) are the ones who derive some amount of genuine enjoyment from the activity.</p><p>Anyway, I’ve been on a beach vacation for the past several days. Something about cramming Day 10 into a red-eye layover and a bumpy flight to Nicragua really took it out of me. That sounds like a pretty good excuse for quitting now, doesn’t it?</p><p>[1] I think my plan backfired because I have actually proved the opposite.</p><p>[2] unless I don’t get the answer.</p><p>You can see my garbage code <a href=https://github.com/melhuang/AoC-23-Swift>here</a>. Days 1-3 were done in a very slow Swift playground, and then I borrowed (stole?) the launch config from a very good friend to start the rest.</p></div><footer class="post-footer clearfix"><div class=share></div></footer></article></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=site-title-wrapper><h1 class=site-title><a href=/>the misfit manager</a></h1><a class="button-square button-jump-top js-jump-top" href=# aria-label="Back to Top"><i class="fa fa-angle-up" aria-hidden=true></i></a></div><p class=footer-copyright><span>&copy; 2023 / Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></span></p></div></footer><script src=/js/jquery-1.11.3.min.js></script><script src=/js/jquery.fitvids.js></script><script src=/js/scripts.js></script></body></html>
